# Intro to Git and JavaScript Pairing Lab

The purpose of this lab is to get you and your partner familiar with `git`, specifically, how to:
* Fork a repository
* `git clone` down a remote repository
* `git add` to stage and `git commit` to commit changes
* `git push` to push up commited changes from a local repo to a remote repo
* `git pull` to pull down changes from a remote repo to a local repo
* Use git to work collaboratively on a shared code base!

## Instructions

> Remember, paired programming means both partner are always looking at, and working off of the same screen! When you are the driver, you group should be working off your computer. And when you switch, you should be working off your partner's computer. By doing so, you will get practice with push and pull using git!

0. You will work in groups of two (no more than three) to implement various JavaScript functions.  
1. One group member, Partner A, will [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository. Only one group memebr should fork the repo. Partner B does not need to fork anything.
2. In the **forked repository**, Partner A needs to add Partner B as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). This means that both groups members will have read and write (edit) access to the forked repo. 
3. Both partners should `git clone` the forked repo to their AWS Cloud9 using SSH. 
4. Partner A will drive first with Partner B being the navigator. Partner A will implement the first function, then stage, commit, and push the changes up to the remote repo (make sure you are in the correct folder in the terminal). 
5. Double check the remote repo on Github to ensure the latest commit was successfully pushed up. 
6. Then, it will be Partner B's turn to drive and Partner A will be the navigator. Partner B needs to `git pull` down the latest commit (make sure you are in the correct folder in the terminal). Once the the code for the first function has been pulled down, Partner B will implement the second function, then push their changes up.
7. Continue switching driver-navigator roles *for every function,* with Partner A implementing all the odd numbered questions and Partner B implementing the even numbers questions. Every time you push up a commit, your partner will need to pull down the changes to their local repo.


## Problems

Be sure to test your functions as you write them! You can invoke the functions after they have been implemented or use `console.log` to print out their return value.

1. Write a function `fiveToOneHundred` that console logs all numbers from 5 to 100.

2. Write a function `multiplesOfThree` that console logs all positive numbers to 100 that is a multiple of 3.
> Multiples of 3 are: `3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ...`

3. Write a function `multiplesOfThreeOrFive` that console logs all positive numbers to 100 if that number is either a mulitple of 3 or a mutliple of 5.
> `3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, ...`

4. Write a function `untilNum` that takes in an integer parameter and console logs all numbers from 1 to that number.
```
untilNum(5)    //prints out numbers 1 through 5
untilNum(9)    //prints out numbers 1 through 9
untilNum(42)   //prints out numbers 1 through 42
```

5. Write a function `multiply` that takes in two number parameters and **returns** their product.
```
multiply(2, 4)     //returns 8
multiply(10, -5)   //returns -50
multiply(3, 7.5)   //returns 22.5
```

6. Write a function `add` that takes in two number parameters and **returns** their sum. But if the two values are the same, return **triple their sum**!
```
add(2, 4)     //returns 6
add(10, -5)   //returns 5
add(3, 7.5)   //returns 10.5
add(5, 5)     //returns 30 because the sum of 5 + 5 = 10 and 30 is triple that
add(6, 6)     //returns 36 because the sum of 6 + 6 = 12 and 36 is triple that
```

7. Write a function `isNegative` that takes in a number parameter and **returns** `true` is the number is a negative value and `false` is the number is a positive value. 
```
isNegative(3)         //returns false
isNegative(-2)        //returns true
isNegative(Math.PI)   //returns false
```

8. Write a function `triangleArea` that takes in the height and base of a triangle and **returns** the [area of the triangle](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-area-triangle-without-right-angle.html). 
```
triangleArea(5, 7)    //returns 17.5
triangleArea(6, 8)    //returns 24
```

9. Write a function `betweenTwentyAndFourty` that takes in a number parameter and checks whether a given integer is within 20 of 100. It **returns** `true` if it is and `false` if not.
```
betweenTwentyAndFourty(4)      //return false
betweenTwentyAndFourty(21)     //return true
betweenTwentyAndFourty(99)     //return true
betweenTwentyAndFourty(101)    //return false
```

10. Write a function `largest` that takes in three number parameters and **returns** the largest of the values.
```
largest(4, 6, 8)        //returns 8
largest(30, 22, 17)     //returns 30
largest(41, 108, 86)    //returns 108
```

### Bonus

11. Write a function `printTime` that prints out the current time in the format `HH:MM:ss`. Do not hard code the hour, minute, or seconds values.

12. Write a function `isLeapYear` to determine whether a given year is a [leap year](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/which-years-are-leap-years-can-you-have-leap-seconds#:~:text=To%20be%20a%20leap%20year,2028%20are%20all%20leap%20years.) in the Gregorian calendar.
```
isLeapYear(2000)    //returns true
isLeapYear(1900)    //returns false
isLeapYear(2020)    //returns true
isLeapYear(1999)    //returns false
```

13. Write a function `getExtention` to get the extension of a filename.
```
getExtention("hello.txt")     //returns ".txt"
getExtention("app.js")        //returns ".js"
getExtention("README.md")     //returns ".md"
```

14. Write a function `absoluteNineteen` to compute the absolute difference between a specified number and 19. Returns triple their absolute difference if the specified number is greater than 19.

15. Write a function `switchLetters` that creates a new string from a given string changing the position of first and last characters. 
```
switchLetters("anne")         //return "enna"
switchLetters("hello world")  //return "dello worlh"
switchLetters("a")            //return "a"
switchLetters("")             //return ""
```

16. Write a function `changeString` to replace every character in a given string with the character following it in the alphabet/
```
changeString("abc")             //return "bcd"
changeString("helloworld")      //return "ifmmpxpsme"
```
